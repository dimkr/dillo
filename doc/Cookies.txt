==================
 Cookies in Dillo
==================

 The  cookie  support in Dillo aims to support cookies of the old
original Netscape style, as well as the kind specified in RFC 2109.

 Cookies are managed outside of dillo by the cookies.dpi. It uses
a  cookies  file  in netscape format so it can be used with other
programs like for example wget.

 Between  sessions cookies are saved to ~/.dillo/cookies.txt, the
old  ~/.dillo/cookies  is read too but not updated. At the moment
the only enforcements on the amount of cookies to save to disk is
max 20 per domain.

 There's also a file for controlling cookies: ~/.dillo/cookiesrc.
Dillo initially sets it to ignore (reject) all cookies, so if you
want to use cookies, change it to meet your needs.

 If you don't want cookies at all, you have two options:

1.- Delete ~/.dillo/cookiesrc (or leave it just as dillo creates it).
2. Configure Dillo with ./configure --disable-cookies. Then all the
   cookie stuff will be skipped at compilation.

Note:  "--disable-cookies"  absolutely eliminates cookie support,
no matter what "cookiesrc" says.



=====================
 Controlling cookies
=====================

 There is a small and simple way to restrict urls from setting cookies
in Dillo. In the file ~/.dillo/cookiesrc You may specify rules
for different domains. The syntax looks something like this:

DEFAULT       DENY
slashdot.org  ACCEPT
.host.com     ACCEPT_SESSION

 The first line says that we should deny all cookies from all domains
by default.
 The second one tells Dillo to save all cookies from slashdot.org
across sessions, until it expires.
 And finally, the third says that all subdomains of host.com should be
allowed to set cookies. But these cookies will only be saved in
memory until you exit.


===================
 Cookies & Privacy
===================

 Cookies can be a severe threat to personal privacy. The pages you
visit can be tracked, logged, and associated to a peronal data-record,
allowing the possibility of building a detailed profile of your
browsing habits.

 This data is sold to companies that profit from direct use of such
information (SPAM, Spying, etc).

 If this data is cross-referenced with other databases, they can end up
with more information than you have about yourself.

 Some people may tell you this is "paranoid". But please, take my words
as those of someone that has written a web browser, a cookies implementation,
and that has deep understanding of HTTP (RFC-2068) and cookies (RFC-2965).

 Non technical persons may like to read:

   http://www.newsfactor.com/perl/story/16455.html (about user-spying)

 The dillo project is especially concerned about privacy and security
issues. Our advice is to avoid cookies whenever possible and at most set
ACCEPT_SESSION to specific, trusted sites.  -- You have been warned.


=========================
 DPI-Dillo comunications
=========================

 The cookies.dpi has the state of the cookies and is the only one
that  reads  and  writes  to  the cookies.txt file. The different
running dillos must ask and send cookies to it.

 To  minimize  communications  between the dpi and dillo clients,
every  different instance of dillo reads 'cookiesrc' and only ask
and send cookies for allowed sites.

 The  cookies.dpi  also  needs  to read 'cookiesrc'. If a site is
changed  to  deny  cookies  in  'cookiesrc',  the cookies dpi can
delete  the cookies for that site from the 'cookies.txt' file the
next time it loads and writes that file.

 All  the work is implemented adding only three new dpi commands,
two really, and a new send bloking dpi command function.

 When  dillo  wants  the cookies for a certain site, it sends the
'get_cookie'  dpi  command  to the cookies.dpi, and the dpi sends
the answer inside a 'get_cookies_answer' dpi command.

 If  an allowed site sends a cookie, dillo uses the 'set_cookies'
dpi command to let the cookies dpi store it.


==============
 Restrictions
==============

 Use  "dpidc  stop"  before  making changes to cookies.txt or any
cookie  files  or  you can lose your changes when the running dpi
rewrites  them. After the cookies dpi reloads the file all dillos
will use the new one.

 If  you change the 'cookiesrc' (previously calling "dpidc stop")
only newly opened dillos will use the changes.


Thats all folks!
